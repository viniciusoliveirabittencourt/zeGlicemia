# zeGlicemia

# A simple website to assistant people to view and monitor their blood glucose

## Why this project ?

I'm a diabetic, so I know how hard can be, you have a total idea about how good your bloog glucose has been doing along the days or weeks, and I know how hard can be to parents or doctors to see how long their patients or children are going their blood glucose. So thinking about it, I descided to do this website, to help me, and help another people, to have a best ideia about their blood glucose along the days, and help parents and doctors to help the people their love, to have a best life. The project is using React Hooks to front, node.js with express to back and PostgreSQL to database, know more in the **Stacks** area.

### Explain Stacks:

To geral app, we are using docker-compose to controll all containers below, GIT to have a best version the code when we can have branchs to front and back, we will use github to CI/CD controll, and the deployment are in Heroku, to back and database, and vercel to front. To tests, I decided have two diferents strategys, tests E2E, to have a geral behavior of the application, and unit tests to have totaly sure I know exactly when it's broken.

All app it will runing with node, and the individual aplication will have their own containers. On front, I will use React, to have a better control of the DOM, and have must control in internal staments. I will use some of the most popular React librarys to help me to construct this application, React Router DOM, to a better control route control and React Redux to have a shared statment to all components. Bootstrap to give facility to contruct a beauty application, and CSS3 to change some bootstrap styles. To back, I will use a Node server, with express to build a web application more easily, JWT to authenticate how are accesing our application, and a ORM called Sequelize, to easily the process of manutention the code.

## Building the application

To run this application on your machine, you need to check your **environment dependencies**, on **Environment Dependencies** has the necessary environment dependencies, and the link to their documentation, where which have the installation mode and version control.

### Run in your machine

#### Open your Linux Terminal:

 ```bash

# First, you need to clone de repositoy in your machine, to this, follow the steps below
~$ git clone git@github.com:viniciusoliveirabittencourt/zeGlicemia.git

~$ cd zeGlicemia

# After this, you will need to install all depedencies
# This command will run the necessary dependencies to run the tests
~/zeGlicemia$ npm install

# Now, enter in the backend directory, to run the command to install all necessary dependencies to run backend
~/zeGlicemia$ cd backend
~/zeGlicemia/backend$ npm install

# Now, enter in the backend directory, to run the command to install all necessary dependencies to run backend
~/zeGlicemia$ cd frontend
~/zeGlicemia/frontend$ npm install

 ```

After all of this, you can run the apps, and see them work on your machine!
